# Personal Blog

This is a simple personal blog website created as part of an assignment. The goal was to demonstrate my skills in building a blog application using React.js and Node.js.

## Features Implemented

- Displaying a list of articles on the main blog page.
- Editing an article (partially implemented).
- Deleting an article.

## Limitations and Areas for Improvement

Due to time constraints and other commitments, I was not able to implement all the desired features within the given timeframe. Here are the areas that need further improvement:

- **Add Article Functionality**: The "Add new article" feature is not yet implemented. The corresponding button is present in the header, but it does not have the functionality to create and save a new article.

- **Edit Article Functionality**: The edit button in each blog item allows you to enter edit mode, but the changes are not reflected in the original blog content. There is a placeholder edit form in the `MainBlog` component, but it does not update the blog data.

Given additional time, I would have been able to address these limitations and complete the full functionality of the application. However, due to my current college commitments, I had to prioritize and complete as much as possible within the given timeframe.

## Setup and Usage

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the development server using `npm start`.
5. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Conclusion

Although the application does not fully meet all the requirements, I have implemented the core features and demonstrated my knowledge of React.js and frontend development. With additional time, I am confident that I could have completed the remaining features and improved the overall functionality and user experience of the application.
